# QuizTime
Currently, a video plays at the end of each quiz; most videos are around 5 - 7 seconds in order to reduce download times.
The use has absolutely no control over the videos, and must watch it until the end.
Originally, the app incorporated AdColony ads at the end of quizzes, but these have been disabled. 
KochavaTracker, which used to track users' actions, has also been disabled.
The app currently uses Flurry to track some user actions, but this will be discontinued in March, 2023.
The efficiency of the app might benefit by having AdColony, Kochava and Flurry code removed completely.

*** NOTE that POD INSTALL will be required to install the required pods ***
